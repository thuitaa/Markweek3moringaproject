    <h1>Akan name generator</h1>
    <p>A great part of Ghanaian culture is their naming system. It is a highly intricate system that assigns different names to children based on their gender. Names are assigned based on the day of the week in which the children were born.</p>
    <p>Using your date of birth that you will enter in the form on the next page, we will be able to apply a complex calculation which will determine which day of the week you were born and hence assign your honorary Akan name.</p>
