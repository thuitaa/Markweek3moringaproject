# Markweek3moringaproject

## Akan Name Generator
Akan names are derived from Ghanaian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born. This project aims to make it clear to interested browsers as to which day of the week they were born using a complex formula integrated into the web program and finally giving them the output of the Akan names that they would have been given.
